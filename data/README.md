# Datasets
This directory contains multiple datasets that we can use to train and test our methods.
- In the `raw` directory contains raw data which has not been preprocessed yet. To understand how to preprocess the data go to README.md in the repository.
- In the `processed` directory contains preprocessed data which we can use to train our methods.
Preprocessed data are saved in `.npy` file to improve loading speed in Pandas.
