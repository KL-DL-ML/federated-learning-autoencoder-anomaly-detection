# Federated Learning on Embedded Devices with Flower

This code will show you how Flower makes it very easy to run Federated Learning workloads on edge devices.
We'll try to implement federated learning in our anomaly detection methods on edge devices to capture any abnormal data from our sensor devices.

## Getting things ready

This is a list of components that you'll need: 

* For server: A machine running Linux/macOS.
* For clients: either a Rapsberry Pi 3 B+ (RPi 4 would work too) or a Jetson Xavier-NX (or any other recent NVIDIA-Jetson device).
